A series of R scripts to read the output from the python script into an R workspace. From there, statistics can be analyzed and 
plotted onto figures. The bulk of the work is done by "functionBooklet.R" which contains functions which create the required 
data structure and load the input files. The typical pipeline used to generate figures and data in [citation] is:

1) Source functionBooklet.R to load required functions and other libraries.
2) Source loadDataSlice.R to open and store requested data as detailed in functionBooklet.R's @getParameterSpace and 
   @getRequestSpace functions. Changes to the requested data to store must be made by altering those functions.
3) Source getFilteredModels.R to output a .txt file containing a list of models which clear the thresholds defined within 
   getFilteredModels.R
4) Source figureGeneration.R to generate the 3x3 panel figures showing the range and mean of each model-parameter combination.
4) Source loadDataList.R to load only the models listed in the .txt output from getFilteredModels.R
5) Source getFilteredModelsFigures.R to create two-panel figures of each model in the .txt output of getFilteredModels.R for
   visual inspection of individual, plausible models.
